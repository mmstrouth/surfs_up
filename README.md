#Surf’s Up Temperature Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis
Before opening the surf shop, W. Avy, an investor known for his love of surfing, requested additional information beyond which was already provided. The analysis compares summary statistics for temperatures in June and temperatures in December. The analysis will help ensure that the surf and ice cream business is sustainable all year-round.

## Results
The following are three key differences in temperature between June and December as shown in the tables above.:
- AVERAGE: The mean temperature in June (74.94℉) is only slightly higher than the mean temperature in December (71.04℉). The medians of both months mirror the recorded means, providing further evidence that the difference in the months’ measures of center is small.
- VARIABILITY: Temperatures typically vary about 3.26 degrees from the mean in June which is slightly less than December’s standard deviation of 3.75 degrees. In other measures of variability, one can note that the range for June temperatures, 21 degrees, is also less than the range for December temperatures, 27 degrees. Half of June temperatures fall between 73℉ and 77℉, creating an interquartile range of 4 degrees and half of December temperatures fall between 69℉ and 74℉, resulting in an interquartile range of 5 degrees. 
- EXTREMES: The highest recorded temperature in December (83℉) is two degrees less than the maximum temperature recorded in June (85℉). The lowest recorded temperatures for June and December have a larger difference of eight degrees, 64℉ and 56℉ respectively. 

## Summary
The analysis reveals evidence that differences in temperature between June and December would have a minimal impact on the success of an ice cream and surf shop. While December temperatures are slightly more varied, the other summary statistics show small differences. 
Two additional queries are suggested:
- Data about temperature fluctuation throughout the day may help inform times that an ice cream and surf shop could be most successful which may vary depending on the month. 
- Descriptions of the weather itself for the months of June and December, for example sunny or partly cloudy, may also help guide other decision-making.
